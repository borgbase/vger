# vger Security Review

A skill for reviewing the security of the vger backup tool — a Rust-based deduplicated, encrypted backup tool inspired by BorgBackup, Restic, and Kopia.

## Context

vger is a backup tool that handles extremely sensitive data: users' files, database dumps, credentials, and encryption keys. A security flaw here is catastrophic — it can mean silent data loss, leaked secrets, or ransomware destroying all backups. The bar for security is higher than a typical application.

This skill should be used to review any code change, new feature, or periodic audit of the vger codebase. It draws on real-world vulnerabilities and security models from BorgBackup, Restic, Kopia, and Rustic.

## How to Use This Skill

When asked to review vger code for security, follow this process:

1. **Identify the scope** — Is this a full audit, a PR review, or a focused review of a specific subsystem (crypto, hooks, config, networking)?
2. **Walk through the checklist** below for the relevant areas
3. **Produce findings** as a prioritized list: Critical > High > Medium > Low > Informational
4. **Suggest fixes** with specific code-level guidance, not just descriptions of problems

## Review Checklist

### 1. Cryptography and Encryption

This is the most critical area. Backup tools live or die by their encryption correctness.

**What to check:**

- **Use AEAD ciphers only.** vger should use AES-256-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305. Flag any use of AES-CTR, AES-CBC, or other non-authenticated modes. Borg 1.x used AES-CTR + HMAC (Encrypt-then-MAC) which was secure but fragile; Borg 2.0 moved to AEAD for good reason.
- **Never roll custom crypto.** All cryptographic operations should use well-audited crates: `aes-gcm`, `chacha20poly1305`, `ring`, or `rustcrypto` family. Flag any manual XOR, custom MAC construction, or hand-rolled key derivation.
- **Use a CSPRNG for secrets.** Keys, nonces, salts, and tokens must come from `OsRng`/`getrandom` (or equivalent CSPRNG). Flag `SmallRng`, `rand_pcg`, `rand_xoshiro`, or other non-cryptographic RNGs in security-sensitive paths.
- **Nonce/IV management.** Every encryption operation needs a unique nonce. Check for:
  - Random nonces from `OsRng` or `getrandom` (preferred for simplicity)
  - Counter-based nonces with proper persistence (Borg's approach — complex, has had bugs)
  - **Never** reusing a nonce with the same key. This is catastrophic for AES-GCM.
  - If using random nonces with AES-256-GCM, verify the nonce is 96 bits and that the number of encryptions under one key stays well below 2^32 (birthday bound).
- **Key derivation from passphrase.** Must use Argon2id (preferred) or scrypt. Flag any use of PBKDF2, bcrypt, or raw SHA-based derivation. Check that:
  - Salt is random and at least 128 bits
  - Argon2id parameters are reasonable (memory ≥ 64 MiB, iterations ≥ 3, parallelism ≥ 1)
  - Parameters are stored with the key so they can be upgraded later
- **Master key architecture.** The passphrase should derive a Key Encryption Key (KEK) that wraps a randomly-generated master key. Never derive the encryption key directly from the passphrase — this allows passphrase changes without re-encrypting the entire repo.
- **Session keys.** Borg 2.0 derives per-session keys from the master key + a session ID. This limits the impact of nonce reuse. Consider whether vger does something similar.
- **Chunk ID derivation.** Chunk IDs must be derived using a keyed MAC (HMAC-SHA256 or keyed BLAKE2b), not a plain hash. Plain hashes allow an attacker with repo access to confirm whether specific files exist in the backup (content fingerprinting attack).
- **Compression + encryption interaction.** Compressing before encrypting can leak information about plaintext through ciphertext size (CRIME/BREACH-style attacks). For a backup tool with offline storage this is low risk, but flag it if compression ratios are observable to an attacker (e.g., exposed via a web API or monitoring metrics).
- **Encrypt-then-MAC ordering.** If not using AEAD, the only acceptable construction is Encrypt-then-MAC. MAC-then-Encrypt and Encrypt-and-MAC are vulnerable to padding oracles. But prefer AEAD which handles this automatically.
- **Associated Authenticated Data (AAD).** When using AEAD, bind the chunk/object ID to the ciphertext via AAD. This prevents an attacker from moving encrypted data between object IDs. Borg 2.0 does this; Restic does not.
- **Constant-time secret checks.** Any comparison of MACs, tokens, or authentication secrets should use constant-time comparisons (for example, `subtle::ConstantTimeEq`), not `==`.
- **Avoid deprecated/insecure crypto dependencies.** Flag deprecated crypto crates, weak modes (ECB), and legacy constructions kept for compatibility without clear migration plans.

**Real-world lessons:**
- Borg CVE-2023-36811: A flaw in the authentication scheme allowed an attacker to fake archives and cause data loss. The manifest authentication was tied to the data format for backward compatibility, creating a gap.
- Restic's Poly1305-AES masking: Filippo Valsorda's audit found the Poly1305 key masking was "pointless, dangerous, and took 45+ minutes to audit" — an example of unnecessary complexity in crypto code.
- Borg's AES-CTR nonce management: Required a persistent nonce counter with reservation system to prevent reuse across crashes. Session-key-based approaches (Borg 2.0) eliminate this class of bugs.

### 2. Key Management and Secrets Handling

**What to check:**

- **Passphrase in memory.** After deriving the KEK, the passphrase should be zeroized from memory immediately. Use the `zeroize` crate with `Zeroizing<>` wrapper. Check that passphrases are not stored in `String` (which may be copied by the allocator) — use `SecretString` or `Zeroizing<Vec<u8>>`.
- **Key material in memory.** All key material (master key, session keys, KEK) should use `Zeroizing<>`. Verify keys are zeroized on drop, not just when the program exits cleanly.
- **No keys in logs or error messages.** Grep for any logging of key material, passphrases, or encryption parameters that include secrets. Check `Debug` trait implementations on key-containing structs — they should redact sensitive fields.
- **Config file permissions.** If the config file contains `passphrase:` in plaintext, vger should warn the user and recommend `passcommand` instead. Check that vger sets restrictive permissions (0600) on any file it creates that contains secrets.
- **passcommand execution.** The `passcommand` is a shell command. Check:
  - It's executed via the user's shell, not via direct exec (to support pipes, variable expansion)
  - stdout is captured, stderr is passed through to the user
  - The output is trimmed of trailing newlines
  - The command is not logged
  - Environment variables like `VGER_PASSPHRASE` are cleared from the environment after use
- **Key file storage.** If vger stores the encrypted key in the repo (like Borg's repokey mode), verify:
  - The key is encrypted with the KEK before storage
  - The encrypted key includes a MAC/authentication tag
  - The salt is stored alongside the encrypted key
  - Multiple keys can exist (for key rotation)
- **Repository swapping attack.** An attacker who controls the storage could swap the entire repository (including key material) with one they control. Borg mitigates this by aborting if BORG_PASSPHRASE doesn't match. Check that vger detects repository identity changes.

### 3. Repository Integrity and Data Verification

**What to check:**

- **Content-addressable verification.** When reading a chunk, verify that its hash matches its ID before decryption. This catches both corruption and tampering.
- **Authentication before decryption.** The MAC/auth tag must be verified before any decryption occurs. Never decrypt unauthenticated data — this prevents chosen-ciphertext attacks and avoids processing attacker-controlled plaintext.
- **Index/manifest integrity.** The snapshot index and manifest must be authenticated. An attacker who can modify the index can:
  - Point snapshots at wrong data (data substitution)
  - Remove snapshots (makes `forget` delete the only copies)
  - Add fake snapshots (to trick retention policies)
- **Lock file security.** If using file-based locks:
  - Lock files on cloud storage are inherently unreliable (no atomic operations)
  - Stale locks must be detectable and breakable (include PID, hostname, timestamp)
  - Lock-free designs (like Duplicacy/Rustic) are preferred
- **Repair safety.** Repository repair operations (`vger check --repair`) must never delete data that might be needed. Flag any repair logic that removes chunks without first verifying they're unreferenced by ALL snapshots.
- **Time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTOU).** Check for gaps between verifying a file's metadata and reading its content during backup. Filesystem snapshots (ZFS/Btrfs/LVM) are the proper fix, but if not available, vger should at minimum detect and warn about files that changed during backup.
- **Arithmetic on untrusted sizes/lengths.** Metadata-driven sizes, offsets, and capacities must use `checked_*`/`try_into()` style conversions. In release builds, integer overflow wraps silently and can invalidate bounds checks.

### 4. Hook Execution Security

Hooks (`before_backup`, `after`, `failed`, etc.) execute arbitrary shell commands. This is a significant attack surface.

**What to check:**

- **Variable injection in hooks.** Hook templates use variables like `{error}`, `{label}`, `{repository}`. If these are interpolated directly into shell commands, an attacker who controls the error message or label name can inject shell commands. Example: a malicious repository could return an error containing `$(rm -rf /)`. Variables must be shell-escaped or passed via environment variables only (not interpolated into the command string).
- **Shell command construction.** Flag any hook implementation that shells out through `sh -c`/`bash -c`/`cmd /c` with untrusted input. Prefer direct argument passing where possible, or strict escaping plus allowlists for dynamic values.
- **Hook execution environment.** Check that hooks:
  - Run with the same privileges as vger (not elevated)
  - Have a clean, minimal environment (don't leak `VGER_PASSPHRASE` or key material)
  - Have a timeout to prevent hangs
  - Have their exit codes checked (`before` hooks should abort on failure)
- **Config file hook injection.** If the config is writable by other users, they can inject hooks. The config file should be owned by the user running vger, with permissions 0600 or 0644.
- **Per-repo hooks in untrusted repos.** If hooks can be stored in the repository itself (like `.vger-hooks`), this is a remote code execution vector. vger should NOT load hooks from repositories — only from the local config file. Kopia requires explicit `--enable-actions` for this reason.

### 5. Configuration Parsing and Input Validation

**What to check:**

- **YAML parsing safety.** YAML has dangerous features (arbitrary code execution in some parsers, billion laughs DoS via entity expansion). Verify vger uses `serde_yaml` or a safe subset parser, not a parser that supports tags or arbitrary constructors.
- **Parser resource limits.** Untrusted config and remote metadata parsing should enforce size/depth limits to prevent recursion bombs, deep nesting stack overflows, and memory exhaustion.
- **Deserialization hardening.** Use dedicated input DTOs and `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` where practical. Avoid deserializing untrusted payloads directly into internal privileged structs.
- **Path traversal.** Source directories, exclude patterns, and restore targets must be validated:
  - No `../` escaping the intended directory
  - Symlinks should be handled explicitly (follow or don't, but document and enforce)
  - Restore should never overwrite files outside the target directory
- **Integer overflow in chunker parameters.** `min_size`, `avg_size`, `max_size` are user-configurable. Verify:
  - They're bounds-checked (min > 0, min ≤ avg ≤ max, max within reasonable bounds)
  - No integer overflow when calculating chunk boundaries (use `checked_*` arithmetic on user-influenced values)
  - No panic in release mode from arithmetic operations on these values
  - Narrowing casts (`as i32`, `as u32`, `as c_int`) are replaced with `try_into()` plus explicit bounds checks
- **Repository path validation.** S3 bucket names, SFTP paths, and REST URLs must be validated. A malicious config could point to unexpected locations.
- **Label/tag validation.** Labels used in CLI commands and config should be restricted to safe characters (alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores). No shell metacharacters, no path separators.
- **Retention policy validation.** Ensure `keep_*` values can't be negative or cause underflow. A retention policy of `keep_last: 0` combined with `forget` could delete all snapshots.

### 6. Unsafe Code Review

**What to check:**

- **Minimize `unsafe` blocks.** Every `unsafe` block should have a `// SAFETY:` comment explaining why it's safe. Flag any `unsafe` without justification.
- **FFI boundaries.** If vger calls into C libraries (libzstd, liblz4, OpenSSL), check:
  - Buffer sizes are validated before passing to C functions
  - Return values are checked for errors
  - Pointers are valid for the expected lifetime
  - No use-after-free across FFI boundary
- **Raw-parts constructors.** Treat `Vec::from_raw_parts` / `slice::from_raw_parts` as high-risk. Verify pointer provenance, allocation ownership, length/capacity correctness, and lifetimes.
- **Unsafe trait impls.** `unsafe impl Send/Sync` must include correct trait bounds on generic types. Missing bounds can create data races reachable from safe code.
- **Transmute and raw pointer use.** Flag any `std::mem::transmute`, `ptr::read`, `ptr::write`, or raw pointer dereference. These are rarely needed in a backup tool.
- **`unsafe` in dependencies.** Run `cargo-geiger` to assess unsafe usage in the dependency tree. Pay special attention to crypto and compression crates.

### 7. Dependency Security

**What to check:**

- **`cargo audit`** — Run and flag any known vulnerabilities. The lz4-sys crate had a memory corruption vulnerability (RUSTSEC-2022-0051); these need to be caught.
- **`cargo deny`** — Check for:
  - License compatibility (all deps should be compatible with BSD-3-Clause)
  - Duplicate versions of the same crate (can indicate supply chain issues)
  - Banned crates (e.g., `openssl` if `ring` or RustCrypto is preferred)
- **Dependency minimization.** A backup tool should have a small dependency tree. Flag unnecessary dependencies that increase attack surface.
- **Pinned versions.** `Cargo.lock` should be committed for the binary. Verify critical security dependencies (crypto, compression) are pinned to specific versions.
- **Build-time dependencies.** Proc macros and build scripts execute arbitrary code at compile time. Review any unfamiliar build dependencies.
- **Typosquatting and lookalike crates.** Verify crate names carefully (`serde` vs lookalikes, etc.) and scrutinize recently added dependencies with low reputation or suspicious naming.
- **Build script/proc-macro trust boundary.** Treat `build.rs` and proc macros as arbitrary code execution during build. Audit new ones explicitly and prefer well-known, maintained crates.
- **Policy tooling.** Consider `cargo vet` or `cargo crev` for dependency trust policy, especially for security-critical releases.

### 8. Network Security (S3, SFTP, REST backends)

**What to check:**

- **TLS certificate validation.** Must be enabled by default. Any option to disable TLS verification should require an explicit flag and print a prominent warning. Never skip certificate validation silently.
- **Danger flags in HTTP clients.** Explicitly flag `danger_accept_invalid_certs(true)` and similar bypasses in `reqwest`/HTTP stacks; these should never be enabled in production paths.
- **Credential handling for cloud backends.**
  - AWS credentials should come from the standard credential chain (env vars, instance profile, config file), never from the vger config
  - SFTP keys should be handled by the system SSH agent, not stored in vger's config
  - REST API tokens should use environment variables or a credential helper
- **Request signing.** S3 requests must use SigV4 signing. Check for any fallback to unsigned requests.
- **Bandwidth limiting.** If vger supports `--limit-upload` / `--limit-download`, verify the rate limiting doesn't have timing side channels that leak information about data content.
- **HTTP parser/protocol hardening.** Review handling of `Content-Length` / `Transfer-Encoding` combinations and malformed headers to avoid request smuggling classes seen in `hyper`-ecosystem CVEs.
- **DoS controls.** Require connection timeouts, request/body size limits, and concurrency caps to reduce slowloris and frame-flooding style attacks.
- **Error message information leakage.** Cloud backend errors should not expose internal paths, credentials, or bucket structures in user-facing error messages or logs.

### 9. Backup-Specific Attack Surfaces

These are unique to backup tools and not covered by generic security checklists.

**What to check:**

- **Append-only mode bypass.** If vger supports append-only repositories (for ransomware protection), verify that:
  - `forget` and `prune` are genuinely blocked, not just at the CLI level
  - The server/storage enforces the policy, not just the client
  - An attacker can't trick `forget` into deleting valid snapshots by adding fake ones
- **Snapshot poisoning.** Can an attacker who gains temporary write access to the repo insert a snapshot that, when later processed by `forget`, causes legitimate snapshots to be deleted? Restic issue #5041 discusses this in detail.
- **Chunk size fingerprinting.** Repository chunk sizes are visible even with encryption. An attacker with repo access can potentially determine if specific known files are in the backup. Mitigations: keyed chunker (Borg's approach), size obfuscation, or configurable chunker parameters with a per-repo secret seed.
- **Metadata leakage.** Even with encryption, the following may be visible:
  - Number of chunks (reveals approximate data size)
  - Chunk modification timestamps (reveals backup schedule)
  - Snapshot count and sizes (reveals data change patterns)
  - File/directory structure if tree metadata isn't encrypted
- **Restore to arbitrary paths.** The restore command must not allow restoring files outside the target directory. Malicious archives could contain entries with `../../etc/crontab` paths. Always resolve and validate the final path.
- **Symlink attacks during backup and restore.** During backup: a symlink could point outside the intended backup scope. During restore: a malicious archive could contain a symlink that, when followed by a subsequent file restore, writes outside the target directory. Restore symlinks first, then validate all target paths.

### 10. Concurrency and Race Conditions

**What to check:**

- **Parallel backup safety.** If multiple vger instances back up to the same repo concurrently, verify:
  - No data corruption from concurrent writes
  - Index updates are atomic or use a conflict-resolution strategy
  - No chunk is partially written and then referenced by another process
- **Signal handling.** Check that SIGINT/SIGTERM during backup:
  - Leaves the repository in a consistent state
  - Doesn't leave orphaned temporary files
  - Doesn't corrupt the index
  - Properly releases any locks
- **Temporary file security.** Any temp files should be created with restricted permissions (0600) in a secure directory. Use `tempfile` crate with appropriate settings. Temp files containing sensitive data should be zeroized before deletion.
- **Bounded async queues.** Flag `tokio::sync::mpsc::unbounded_channel()` in network-facing paths unless there is strict upstream backpressure.
- **`tokio::select!` cancellation safety.** Losing branches are dropped; verify partial state is not lost or left inconsistent when one branch wins.
- **Panic behavior in async locks.** `tokio::sync::Mutex` does not poison on panic. Verify state validation/recovery when tasks panic while holding locks.

## Security Review: [component/PR name]

### Critical
- **[CRIT-1] Nonce reuse in chunk encryption** — `src/crypto/encrypt.rs:42`
  The nonce counter is not persisted across process restarts, allowing nonce
  reuse after a crash. With AES-256-GCM, this compromises both confidentiality
  and authenticity of all data encrypted with the reused nonce.
  **Fix:** Use random nonces (96-bit from OsRng) instead of counters, or
  persist the counter with atomic file writes before encrypting.
